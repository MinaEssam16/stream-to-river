## Overview

English | [ä¸­æ–‡](README_CN.md)

[Streams to River](https://sstr.trae.com.cn/) is an innovative English learning application designed to help users record, extract, and manage English words, sentences, and relevant contexts encountered in daily life. This tool integrates the principles of the [Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve) to facilitate periodic learning and effective memorization.

During the development phase, we extensively utilized [TRAE](https://www.trae.ai) for code development, debugging, annotation, and writing unit tests. We also integrated features like image-to-text, real-time chat, speech recognition, and word highlighting through the [Coze workflow](https://www.coze.com/).
